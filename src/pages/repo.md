Suppose you have a clean folder. You can initialize a Git repository by typing


```shell
  git init
```

What does this command do? It creates a .git folder in the folder where you ran it. If you don’t see it, it’s because it’s a hidden folder, so it might not be shown everywhere, unless you set your tools to show hidden folders.
